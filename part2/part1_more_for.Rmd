## More about For Loops

Given what we know so far about vectors, we might want to do something with each value in a vector.

For example, say I had the following strings:

```{r}

pets <- c("dog", "cat", "mouse")


for(pet in pets){print(pet)}

```

The curly brackets {} contain functions that you want to apply to each value in the vector.


```{r}

for(pet in pets){print(paste("my favorite animal is a", pet))}
```


Let's take some miles per gallon readings and convert them to miles per liter. We know that there are 3.78 liters in a gallon:

```{r}
cars_mpg <- c(20, 30, 44.2)

for(car in cars_mpg){
  car_mpl <- car / 3.71
  print(car_mpl)
}
```
