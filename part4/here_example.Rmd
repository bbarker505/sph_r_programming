```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Motivation for here

Let's knit this in the root folder first.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

smoke_complete <- read_excel("data/smoke_complete.xlsx", 
                             sheet=1, 
                             na="NA")
```

Now try moving this document into the `markdown` folder and try knitting it there. It won't work!

Now modify the above code chunk to contain this code:

```
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)

smoke_complete <- read_excel(
                   here("data/smoke_complete.xlsx"), 
                   sheet=1, 
                   na="NA")

```
