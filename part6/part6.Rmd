# Learning Objectives

-   **Process** elements of a list one at a time using `for` loops
-   **Write** and **use** functions that can be applied (or `map`ped) to elements of a list
-   **Consolidate** elements of a list using `reduce()`.
-   Write a pipeline that fails gracefully using `possibly()` and `safely().`

## Reminder

Please go through `tidyowl::learn_lists()` before you start this unit. You'll need to understand how lists work and how we put things into them and get things out of them for this unit to make sense.


```{r}
library(tidyowl)
learn_lists()
```




## Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) - use functions!

If you do something in R once and have to do it again, it's probably best to think of how to do it well once, rather than cutting and pasting again.

For example, say that you have multiple files that have the same format and you want to load them all into R, and glue them into a single dataset.

Part of doing this is by using and writing *functions*. We can take code that we might have to write 10 times in a row, and package it in a way that we can use it multiple times.

```{r}
load_files <- function(path){
  out_frame <- readxl::read_excel(path)
  out_frame <- janitor::clean_names(out_frame)
  return(out_frame)
}
smoke1 <- load_files("data/smoke_1.xlsx")
smoke1
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
files_to_load <- list.files(path="data/", full.names = TRUE)
files_to_load
```

Now we can utilize our `load_files()` function that takes these file locations (or paths) as an argument for this function.

```{r eval=FALSE}
load_files(files_to_load[1])
```




## For Loops

Why do we need functions?

If we do something once with a function, we can do it multiple times on different elements in a list with that function. This is especially true in the case of loading files. When we run the same function on different elements of a dataset, it is known as *iteration*.

Let's go through the bottom code below. You've seen for loops before, but it's worth reviewing.

The tricky thing to understand is that `single_file` is a *placeholder*. It changes each time we go through the loop, and it's a way to refer to the element of the list that time around.

We use our function `load_files()` on `single_file`. Because `load_files()` returns a `data.frame`, we need to store the output somewhere. So, we're storing the `data.frame` into a slot of a list called `file_list`.

```{r}
#initialize an empty list
file_list <- list()


#use single_file as a placeholder
for(single_file in files_to_load){
  #show what single file is
  print(single_file)
  
  loaded_file <- load_files(single_file)
  #put the contents of loaded file into a slot with
  #the name of the file.
  
  file_list[[single_file]] <- loaded_file
}


file_list
```

### Your turn

Try subsetting `files_to_load` to contain just the second and third elements. How many elements does `file_list2` contain? What are their `names()`?

```{r}
file_list2 <- list()

files_to_load2 <- files_to_load[2:3]


for(single_file in files_to_load2){
  file_list2[[single_file]] <- load_files(single_file)
}
file_list2
```

## purrr::map()

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/purrr_cat.png")
```

Initializing an empty list and using a `for` loop is a bit clunky. We can do better. Enter the `purrr` package and `map()`.

`purrr::map()` lets us *apply* a function to each element of a list. It will always return a list with the number of elements that is the same as the list we input it with. Each slot of the returned list will contain the output of the functions applied to each element of the input list.

The way to read a `map()` statement is:

    `map(.x = files_to_load, .f = load_files)` 

> We're going to apply (map) our function .f,
>
> `load_files(),`
>
> to the `list` called `files_to_load`.

```{r}
file_list <- purrr::map(.x = files_to_load, .f = load_files)
file_list
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/map_frosting.png")
```

In other words, we're taking a list of something (`cupcakes`), applying a function (`frost()`) to each of them. Thus, we should get back three frosted cupcakes.

Where does the list come from? By default, `map()` returns the results of your functions to a list.




### Your Turn

Use `map()` to return the `length` of each of the elements in `my_list`. 

Remember that you don't want to put the `()` after the function name.

```{r}
my_list <- list(cat_names = c("Morris", "Julia"), 
                hedgehog_names = "Spiny", 
                dog_names = c("Rover", "Spot"))
lengths <- map(.x = my_list, .f = ------)
lengths
```

If we know what data type we want to return, we can use one of the `map_*` functions. We know that the lengths should return `integer`, so let's use `map_int().`

Check the class of `lengths2` - is it a `list` or a `vector`?



```{r}
lengths2 <- map_int(my_list, length)
lengths2
```




## Passing in multiple parameters

If you were using a function such as `mean`, you might want to specify an argument to it, such as `na.omit=TRUE`.

```{r}
my_list2 <- list(vec1 = c(10, 133, 1, NA), 
                 vec2 = c(11, 12, NA, 4), 
                 vec3 = c(1, 5, NA, 4)
                 )
map(my_list2, mean)
```

How do we do this? We can add any arguments that we need to by adding them after our function.

```{r}
map(my_list2, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```

There is another way to specify arguments to a function, but to explain it will require some work. We'll use what's called **formula notation** to specify a function, and the `.` to specify the **current element** (much like a placeholder variable in a for loop) in the list we're processing. We'll talk about this below.

```{r}
map(my_list2, ~mean(x = ., na.rm = TRUE))
```




## Anonymous Functions to save typing

One thing about when you look at other peoples' `purrr` code is that it can be super confusing. There's all sorts of weird notation, such as `.` and `~`. Depending on what your function does, and what is in your `list`.

`purrr`/`dplyr` has a shorthand way of defining functions, called *anonymous* functions, using the *formula* notation:

    ~mean(.$bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)

is the same as

    function(x) {
       mean(x$bill_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
       }

The `~` basically takes the place of `function(x)` and the `.` takes the place of `x`.

Let's use the `split()` function to split our data.frame into a list:

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
data(penguins)
penguins_by_species <- penguins %>%
  split(.$species) 
penguins_by_species
```

Notice that in the above we use `.`, which is a way to refer to what's in the current element of a list. In our case, we are using `.` to refer to the `data.frame` in the current slot position:

```{r}
purrr::map(.x = penguins_by_species, 
          .f =  ~nrow(.))
```

The nice thing about anonymous functions is that you can pass in additional parameters within the function, rather than placing them outside of the function.



### Your Turn

What does the following code do? How did we supply the `na.rm` argument?

```{r}
purrr::map(penguins_by_species, 
             ~mean(.$bill_depth_mm, na.rm  = TRUE))
```




## `purrr::reduce()`

Once we've done something to our `data.frame`s in `my_list2`, how do we combine them?

We can use another command called `purrr::reduce()` that will take our list and combine them together, one element at a time.

The big difference between `map()` and `reduce()` has to do with what it returns:

> `map()` usually returns a list or data structure with the same number as its input;
>
> The goal of `reduce` is to take a list of items and return a single object.


```{r}
bound_file <- purrr::reduce(file_list, dplyr::bind_rows) 
dim(bound_file)
```

### Your Turn

Use `purrr::reduce` to find the total number of rows in all three files using `sum`.

```{r}
file_rows <- purrr::map(file_list2, nrow)
purrr::reduce(file_rows, -----)
```




## `map_*`: Return a specific data type

There are a lot of `map_` functions, as you can see if you type in `map_:`

-   `map_int()` - function should return an integer
-   `map_int()` - function should return an integer
-   `map_lgl()` - function should return a logical value
-   `map_dbl()` - function should return a double (decimal) value
-   `map_df`() - function should return a `data.frame`

The main difference between these is that they are *strict*: if you function doesn't return the desired data type, it will return an error.

```{r}
file_list <- purrr::map_df(files_to_load, load_files)
file_list
```

Why do this? It's good coding practice, because you're guaranteeing that you will return something in that format.




## Failing Gracefully: `possibly()` and `safely()`

We might have a list of objects where one of the elements is *faulty*. Maybe there's no data in it, only a big `NA`. That is what `possibly()` is for. Let's add an element to `files_to_load` that isn't a file path:

```{r}
files_to_load3 <- c("blah", files_to_load)
files_to_load3
```

If we `map` `load_files()` on this vector, we're going to get an error, because there is no file called `blah`:

```{r}
test <- map(files_to_load3, load_files)
```

Arrgh, it stopped at the first element! We need to use `possibly()` to *wrap* around our function. We first need to define new function called `load_files_possibly()`. The second argument (`otherwise`) is what the function will return if there's an error. 

```{r}
load_files_possibly <- possibly(.f = load_files, otherwise = NULL)

load_files_possibly(files_to_load3[1])
```

You can see that it returns a `NULL` value rather than returning an error.

Now we can use `load_files_safely()` on our list:

```{r}
file_list <- map(files_to_load3, load_files_possibly)
file_list
```

The nice thing about returning `NULL` instead of an error here is that we can continue to work. That is, the `NULL` value won't affect our `reduce()`:

```{r}
reduce(file_list, bind_rows)
```


## Chopping up a data frame by group: `split()`

We've seen `group_by`, which can group the rows of a data.frame by a factor. 

Sometimes it is easier to split the dataframe into a list and work from there.





## Working with Two Lists at a Time: map2()

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("image/map2_cupcakes.png")
```

Say we had two lists with two elements, and one list contains elements that we want to combine with the other list somehow. `map2()` lets us use both lists as arguments to a function.

Here we're using the `paste()` function to paste our two vectors together, element by element.

```{r}
cupcakes <- c("cupcake", "croissant", "shortcake")
frostings <- c("vanilla", "chocolate", "strawberry")
map2(frostings, cupcakes, paste)
```

### Your Turn

Use `map2()` to resample the `penguins` data three times.

```{r}
indices <- map(1:3, ~sample(x = 1:nrow(penguins), size = 40, replace = FALSE))
map(indices, ~(penguins[.,]))

```




## Where Next?

Using and understanding `purrr` functions opens up something really powerful: parallel computing. You can have multiple cores of a machine running iterations of your list using the `furrr` (short for future purrr) package.

Learning more about functions and vectorization will help you to reduce the number of mistakes in analysis.
