## This is a Slidy Presentation

Slidy is one quick way to transform an RMarkdown document into a presentation. It's compatible with most of the `html_document` options. Each slide is defined as by a `##` (header level 2)

What are the other options? There is Xaringan, which uses remark.js. It takes a little more time to setup and use, so I don't recommend it when you're getting started.

## Here's a Table Slide

```{r}
penguins[1:5,]
```

## Here's a Figure Slide

```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +
  aes(x = species, y= flipper_length_mm, fill = species) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(vars(island))

```
